# intro_r_rstudio

This material was designed to give an overview of R and RStudio in a one-hour Customer Success session. That's not a lot of time for learning R! But you have to start somewhere, so this will be a bird's-eye view of what R and RStudio even are (say that out loud), a tour of the RStudio IDE (integrated development environment, AKA what you see when you open up RStudio), and some orientation to where to go from here to foster your lifelong R learning.

The worksheet allows you to do some self-guided learning using a dataset that was featured in #tidytuesday way back in 2020, which contains measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination rates for tens of thousands of schools.
